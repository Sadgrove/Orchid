              <h2>Taking digital freedom into our own hands</h2>
              <h5>Sunday, October 24th, 2021</h5>
              <div>
               <img src="https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/shutterstock_531875605-800x450.jpg" alt="digital freedom image" width=100%;/></div>
               <p>For my first post, I wanted to explain my reasoning behind my website and the blog in particular. I’ve been thinking a lot recently about our freedom as individuals and the role that the internet plays in all of this. I could mention a lot of ways that the internet has allowed us to have an unprecedented amount of freedom, a freedom that 100 years ago would have been impossible to imagine. You’re free to research any topic you wish at the wiggle and click of some fingers. Want to learn about biology? Rabbits? The Sun? Want to watch porn or a movie that will make you laugh? You got it! It can be debated whether this level of freedom is a good thing. I think that it should be debated. It’s not obvious to me that porn is any good for anyone’s sex life, or life in general. It’s not obvious that having endless entertainment so easily accessible is good for one’s life either. I also think, and it’s a surprising realisation, that it’s not obvious that multitudes of information is good for us either. Although it might be. </p>
               <br>
               <p>There is no doubt that we live in a time that can be confusing. What is real and what is not? I write this referring to the information that we see online. But that question is not a new one to our modern times, and it stretches beyond information and into the existential. What is real? This is a question for us to chew on our whole life, and I’m not sure if it will ever digest fully. Well… Maybe when we’re Buddha’s!</p>
               <br>
               <p>To avoid being Nihilistic about this confusion, my philosophy is to aim towards truth and accept that not only is it not easy, but that I will fail. When I fail, I just aim towards truth again and continue this practice until my death. This is a meditation, to pay attention is to turn towards truth. Inevitably you will get distracted. So, you turn back again. This might seem like laborious work, but it does get easier and also, what’s the alternative?</p>
               <br>
               <p>This philosophy is the core of my artistic life, to use art and expression as a movement towards truth. I use art and music as a medium to explore what truth is and that’s also why I have included a blog on my website. I’m not convinced that out current forms of communication allow for a healthy or productive truth-seeking discussion. Everyone seems to be against each other, and not in a healthy way. But in a ‘attack and destroy’ sort of way. Maybe I’m a little cynical on the matter, but it seems like most people have forgotten or have never been taught how to have a healthy discussion. It’s ok to disagree, but why do you disagree? Do you understand why someone else thinks differently than you? If you don’t understand that, then how can you say that you know better than them? </p>
               <br>
               <p>Over the past couple of years, I’ve witnessed intelligent and thoughtful people being (I believe) misunderstood, demonised and cancelled. It isn’t even the cancelling that I have the biggest problem with. I think it’s problematic in many ways. But as the internet stands, the websites are privately owned. So, it’s up to the owners to decide if someone’s voice is allowed. I could argue against this also. For the internet has become such a public space, even a public necessity if you want to have a normal social life, that to be taken off it, is a big hit to someone’s life. It’s the modern-day form of banishing or exile! But what bothers me most, is how I’ve seen information get so skewed, maybe it’s some internet form of Chinese whispers. But people’s words get taken out of context and somehow what someone says can turn into its polar opposite, and when I’ve got into conversations by such people, I’m genuinely curious how they came to their assumptions. Often, when I ask them if they’ve read a book or listened to talks or podcasts by this person that they vehemently despise, they say no, or they say that they listened for 5 minutes, wanted to puke and turned it off.  Now if the person was saying “let’s go out and kill all these people, spare no lives, follow Satan and babies are ugly”, I would get it. But I know that that’s not the case. Because I’ve listened for a lot longer than 5 minutes and never heard such a thing. </p>    
               <br>
               <p>So, the idea of this blog is to talk about things, hopefully in a balanced way and encourage people to have reasoned discussion and at least TRY to understand each-other. It is an experiment in free speech. Owning my own website means that no one is getting censored or de-platformed. </p>
               <br>
               <p>In my next post I’ll inquire into my philosophy about free speech and its challenges. </p>

               <h2>The future of Music in Virtual and Augmented reality</h2>
               <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
               <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
               <p>Virtual reality (VR) is awesome. Only recently did I have my first experience, and my mouth was open in awe for a good 2 hours. What amazed me the most was an interactive story called ‘Goliath’. ‘Goliath’ is a story about Schizophrenia and being unable to decipher what is real and what is not. This was a very poignant story indeed, I don’t know what it’s like to be schizophrenic, but I feel that the virtual reality world is an incredibly powerful place to tell that story. VR brings up the question of what is real? When you allow yourself to think about it more deeply, it does not make sense to dismiss the virtual world as not being real. </p>
               <br>
               <p>Where does real end and virtual begin? To me the dividing line has become incredibly ambiguous. Is Virtual reality only so when you put on a headset? Is social media not some form of virtual reality? It’s a virtual space where we communicate, navigate and share. Plus, the virtual world is made up of sound and images, aren’t sound and image fundamentally physical? </p>
               <br>
               <p>What struck me as interesting is the thought that we have been augmenting reality with music for many years. When we wear headphones the sonic landscape of our experience is transformed and ‘AUGMENTED’ due to the music. But to think of it further through history to live music. Musical instruments are forms of technology, just like VR goggles, technology that transforms our perception of reality. </p>
